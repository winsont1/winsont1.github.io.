The source code for all posts on this site, as well as the site itself, can be found on [my Github profile](https://github.com/winsont1). The site is built in Ruby using the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) library, using fork of the [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) theme. The data analysis is completed in Python.
